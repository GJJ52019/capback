# SimPy Storage
  The object with this repo is to demonstrate a possible setup for a django database to host data from a simpy file


##  current state
Currently the database is deployed and hosted but there is no link between it and the simulation file.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- JSON
- Python
- Django
- Heroku

## links:

## Getting Started:
- currently the data is full CRUD but no way to automate the postings.
- The current model while a place holder is an insight into the complex amount of variables that go into making a simulation and the data it can hold.
- user can edit the data to create a log for them selves to work with if they wanted to to keep track of metrics across the day.


## Future Enhancements:
- Simpy file to post to database.
- change the model from days to hours for better tracking.
- if possible make a way to trigger simulation file from online site.
